# GitHub Upload Instructions

## 📁 Files Ready for Upload

Your portfolio is now ready to be uploaded to GitHub! Here's what you need to do:

### 1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
- Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
- Click "New repository"
- Name it something like `portfolio` or `arun-portfolio`
- Make it public (for GitHub Pages)
- Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 2. **Upload All Files**
Upload the entire `portfolio` folder contents to your GitHub repository:

```
portfolio/
├── index.html                              ← Welcome page
├── bio.html                                ← Biography page
├── artifacts.html                          ← Projects showcase
├── A Timeline of AI Evolution.pptx         ← Your presentation file
├── artifacts/
│   ├── artifact1.html                      ← Chatbot project details
│   ├── artifact2.html                      ← AI Lab documentation details
│   └── artifact3.html                      ← AI Evolution timeline details
├── styles/
│   └── main.css                           ← All styling
├── scripts/
│   └── main.js                            ← Interactive functionality
└── README.md                               ← Portfolio documentation
```

### 3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch
5. Click "Save"

### 4. **Update Presentation URLs (Important!)**
After uploading, you need to update the presentation URLs in these files:

**File:** `artifacts/artifact3.html`
**File:** `scripts/main.js`

Replace `yourusername/yourrepo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name in these URLs:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/A%20Timeline%20of%20AI%20Evolution.pptx
```

**Example:** If your GitHub username is `arunvallala` and repository is `portfolio`, the URL would be:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arunvallala/portfolio/main/A%20Timeline%20of%20AI%20Evolution.pptx
```

### 5. **Your Portfolio Will Be Live At:**
```
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepositoryname/
```
