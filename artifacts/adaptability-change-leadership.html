                        <h3>The Situation</h3>
                        <p>During my employment and visa transition process in the U.S., our organization went through multiple internal changes — including HR restructuring and shifting immigration policies. At one point, I faced a denied H-1B Change of Employer (COE), followed by transitioning to an F-1 status. These transitions were complex, involving lawyers, HR, and immigration timelines.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the team managing the change followed a rigid protocol without adapting to the unique sequence of events in my case. This lack of adaptability created unnecessary stress and complications in an already complex process.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How Adaptive Learning Could Have Helped</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Flexible Timeline Adjustment:</strong> The team could have adjusted timelines and strategy after the COE denial rather than sticking to a template</li>
                            <li><strong>Personalized Guidance:</strong> They could have proactively integrated my feedback or questions into their approach to personalize the guidance I received</li>
                            <li><strong>Agile Policy Monitoring:</strong> Continuous monitoring of USCIS policy updates and more agile planning would have allowed for quicker adjustments</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Key Insight</h3>
                        <p>This experience highlighted that even bureaucratic or structured processes benefit from adaptability — especially when dealing with change that affects people directly.</p>

                        <h3>Scenario Title: Rescuing the AI Launch – A Case in Tech Education</h3>
                        <p><strong>Tool used:</strong> ChatGPT (OpenAI)</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Situation</h3>
                        <p>At a fast-growing edtech startup, the CTO leads a project to deploy an adaptive learning platform for online coding bootcamps. The system uses AI to personalize lessons based on real-time student performance.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Challenges</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The AI incorrectly flags advanced students as underperforming due to narrow model training</li>
                            <li>Instructors push back, saying the system interferes with their teaching flow</li>
                            <li>Enrollment rates drop due to confusion over how the new system works</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Adaptive Leadership Response</h3>
                        <p>Rather than defend the original roadmap, the CTO practices adaptive leadership:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>She pauses the deployment to gather user feedback from both instructors and students</li>
                            <li>Her team retrains the AI using a more diverse dataset and improves explainability features</li>
                            <li>They organize optional training for instructors and adjust the messaging on the platform's landing page</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>The Outcome</h3>
                        <p>Within three weeks, the AI's accuracy improves, and instructors begin to trust the system more. By listening, iterating, and staying flexible, the CTO turns a fragile launch into a sustainable, scalable solution.</p>

                            <p>Both my experience and the hypothetical scenario underscore the importance of adaptive learning in leadership. Whether dealing with immigration processes or AI implementation, leaders must remain open to feedback, learn from missteps, and adjust their strategy based on evolving data. This flexibility builds resilience — not just in systems, but in people and organizations too.</p>
